GENERAL

The zeroplayer is a small media player that can play mp3 music and mp4 videos on a small Raspberry Pi computer.
I wrote it as I had a PiZero and an extra 320 by 240 pixel TFT display hanging around.

OPERATING SYSTEM

The starting point is the "Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) with desktop".
I chose the Debian Buster version released on 2020-08-20.

As we need X11 for displaying the widgets I would go for the desktop version.

INSTALL FONTS

We need three fonts that are not usually found on the Raspberry Pi OS.

To get and install these fonts by running this script:

cd scripts
./get_fonts.sh

INSTALL PACKAGES

cd scripts
./install_packages.sh

MUSIC AND VIDEOS

The zeroconf player looks for the media in the folder /media/pi/MUSIC

You could format your USB stick and give it the name MUSIC to be compatible with zeroplayer.

It will look for a playlist file called ALLTracks.m3u that should be at the top directory of the USB stick.
eg. /media/pi/MUSIC/ALLTracks.m3u

The content of the playlist is the files listed in the format performer/album/track.

/media/pi/MUSIC/Albert Lee/Album/RocknRollMan.mp3
/media/pi/MUSIC/Jellyroll/Album/Jellyroll Jump.mp3
/media/pi/MUSIC/Postmodern Jukebox/Album/All About That Bass.mp4

RUNNING

You can start the player manually.

cd zeroplayer/src
./zeroplayer.py

CONTROLS

There is 3 ways to control the player.

1) Touch screen or mouse
- click anywhere on the top bar for Play or Stop
- click on right side of the screen for Next Track
- click on left side of the screen for Previous Track

2) GPIO buttons.
The fbtft screens usually have 4 buttons below the screen.
- press leftmost button for Previous Track

- press 3rd button for Next Track

3) Keyboard

AUTOSTART AT BOOT

Add a line to the end of the file /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDG-pi/autostart
